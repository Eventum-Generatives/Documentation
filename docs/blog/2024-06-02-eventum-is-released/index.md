I'm thrilled to announce the release of Eventum 1.0 - the flexible event generator that brings a new level of flexibility and creativity.

### Background
I started working on this project in November 2023 as an alternative to the simple generator we had in our development team.

Gradually, more complex use cases for the generator emerged, and it became increasingly difficult to achieve the required functionality. At one point, I realized I was ready to create something new and introduce it to the team.

I have preserved many unforgettable events in Eventum that happened to me during the development period, and I hope this has made Eventum a bit more eventful ðŸ”®
